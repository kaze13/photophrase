# **Version 1.0 - PhotoPhrase Launch**
We are thrilled to introduce PhotoPhrase, an innovative app designed to help you discover your memories and moments through a simple text search. With PhotoPhrase, finding your cherished moments is as easy as typing "beach photos from last summer" or "birthday party in 2020".

#### What's New
- **Search Photo by Text**: Just type in phrases or descriptions, and let PhotoPhrase find the corresponding photos from your library.
- **Similar Photo Search**: Use a photo to find more like it with our reverse image search functionality.
- **Efficient Album Management**: Organize your images with text, tags, and bookmarks, and easily discard the ones you don't need.
- **Privacy-Centric**: Your photos stay on your device. PhotoPhrase operates entirely offline, ensuring your privacy and lightning-fast search speeds.

Rediscover your memories with PhotoPhrase. Enjoy exploring your photo album like never before!
