I've been loving your tech reviews and your take on apps is always spot on! I've developed an app called PhotoPhrase that lets you search for photos with natural language, and it works completely offline. I think it could be a great fit for your channel. Would you be interested in checking it out for a review? No worries if not, just thought it could be up your alley! ðŸ˜Š
